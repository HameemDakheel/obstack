> **Production observability for your $20/month VPS.** All 5 signals (logs, metrics, traces, profiles, dashboards). One command. No headache.

---

## What is this?

OTel-jps is an OpenTelemetry-native observability stack you self-host on a single Linux VPS. After one command, you have:

- **Grafana** with 4 pre-built dashboards already populated with live data
- **Prometheus** for metrics
- **VictoriaLogs** for logs (87% less RAM than Loki, 94% lower query latency)
- **Tempo** for distributed traces
- **Pyroscope** for continuous profiling
- **Caddy** with automatic Let's Encrypt TLS
- 12 pre-tuned alert rules ready to fire
- cAdvisor for per-container resource metrics

**Total idle RAM: ~310 MB.** Fits comfortably on a 4 GB VPS with room for your application.

This is **not** an enterprise stack scaled down. It's an observability stack designed from day one for self-hosters: solo devs, indie SaaS founders, the r/selfhosted crowd. If you don't want to operate a Kubernetes cluster but still want production-grade observability, this is for you.

## Quick install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HameemDakheel/OTel-jps.git
cd OTel-jps
cp .env.example .env

# Generate basic-auth hash for OTLP ingestion
docker run --rm caddy:2-alpine caddy hash-password --plaintext 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# (paste output into .env as BASIC_AUTH_HASH)

make simple
make verify
```

Open `https://localhost/` (or your domain). Login: `admin` / value of `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`.

Full walkthrough: **[5-minute Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md)**.

## What you get out of the box

Four pre-built dashboards in Grafana's "OTel-jps" folder, populated with **real data** from second 1 (the stack monitors itself):

- **Stack Health** — every component up/down, OTLP ingestion rates by signal, per-component memory
- **Container Metrics** — per-container CPU / RAM / network (cAdvisor)
- **Logs Explorer** — recent logs across the stack and your apps
- **Traces Browser** — service graph + span duration heatmap

Plus 12 pre-tuned alerts (service down, high error rate, disk full, cert expiring, ingestion drop, cardinality explosion, …) and 4 datasources connected and queryable.

## How it compares

| | OTel-jps | SigNoz | OpenObserve | Grafana LGTM (DIY) | Datadog |
|---|---------|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| **License** | MIT | Apache 2.0 | AGPL/Apache | AGPL (mixed) | Proprietary |
| **Idle RAM** | ~310 MB | 4-152 GB | ~300 MB | ~3 GB | n/a |
| **Fits 4 GB VPS** | ✅ | ❌ (prod docs say 56 CPU / 152 GB) | ✅ | ❌ | n/a |
| **All 5 signals** | ✅ | ❌ (no profiling) | ❌ (no profiling) | ✅ | ✅ |
| **One-command install** | ✅ `make simple` | ✅ `docker compose up` | ✅ single binary | ❌ DIY assembly | n/a |
| **Auto-provisioned dashboards on first run** | ✅ 4 | partial | partial | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Pre-tuned alert pack** | ✅ 12 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Self-hosted** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Cost predictable** | ✅ ($20 VPS) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ ($1.50-3.50 / GB) |

## See it with real microservice traces

Want to see what the stack looks like with a credible microservice workload? Run the [optional OTel demo overlay](demo/README.md):

```bash
make demo
```

This adds 7 services from the [official OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) (Astronomy Shop subset) plus a load generator. The Traces Browser dashboard immediately shows the service graph: frontend → cart → checkout → payment → recommendation. Needs ~8 GB RAM total — use a bigger machine for evaluation.
